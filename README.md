Repository for the codefundo.

# The Problem-
Problem the authorities facing now is is how to control the damage caused by floods. The floods can easily be predicted and lives of people can be saved by taking proper measures. 

# My Solution-
We need to keep records of recent climatic changes, changes in air pressure, chages in direction of wind, temperature and rainfall forecast to predict the harm that might be caused by floods.
